You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

* The most important skill I’ve learned is the importance of having go-to resources. Google is a lot more useful when you have consistent resources like MDN, etc. 
* Everything has been fairly easy to understand.
* Relative paths was slightly tricky at first.
* I’m keeping where I want to go with everything in mind. Problems are going to be a lot harder soon!
